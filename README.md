# car-price-prediction-model
This project uses Linear Regression and Lasso Regression to predict car prices based on features such as brand, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and more. The goal is to provide a data-driven way to estimate the fair value of used cars, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
